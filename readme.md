* Error log as a CSV file.
* Passwords encrypted in the DB.
* Safe from SQL injection, URL guessing, passing bad ids in URLs, and other attacks.
* DB connection data and logs stored outside app file space.
* Extensive validation on data fields.
* Simple template for pages makes app-wide code changes easy.
* Four user roles (admin, staff, faculty, student) with different permissions.
* Users can have more than one role.
